# Workshop Domain

This domain is described in [[Furelos-Blanco, 2017]](#ref-furelos-mthesis). As in the case of the [Maze](../maze) domain, there are two different domains depending on the multiagent notation used:

* `workshop_dom_cal.pddl` for [[Kovacs, 2012]](#ref-kovacs) notation.
* `workshop_dom_cn.pddl` for [[Crosby, Jonsson and Rovatsos, 2014]](#ref-crosby-ecai14) notation.

The problems in the `problems` folder can be related to any of the domains. Besides, inside this folder there is a folder called `generator` containing a Python script for creating new instances. The generated instances have the following features:

* There are connected buildings forming a tree. Buildings are linked by locked security doors.
* Each bulding has a number of rooms which are connected via unlocked doors, forming a tree.
* In each building there is a switch and a key for each of the security doors it is connected to. The key and the switch are randomly placed in one of its rooms.
* Pallets and forklifts are randomly placed in rooms.
* Two agents are placed in the same room as a forklift.

You can use the generator as follows:

```
python generate_instance.py <num-agents> <num-pallet> <num-buildings> <num-rooms-per-building> <num-instance>
```
