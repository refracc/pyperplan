# CoDMAP-15 Domains
The `codmap15` folder contains 12 different domains that were used in the [Competition of Distributed and Multiagent Planners (CoDMAP)](http://agents.fel.cvut.cz/codmap/). Some domains, apart from the original `domain.pddl` file, contain a `domain_constrained.pddl` forcing some constraints on the concurrency between actions using  [[Kovacs, 2012]](#ref-kovacs) specification.
